# Benchmark: WebAssembly & Pmem

### Purpose & Content

The websites work as benchmark and generate score through a series of tests. For WebAssembly the tests are face detection, game, and phys_engine. For Pmem, it includes loading a MIDI file and a piece of video named Epic Zen Garden.

### Needs and Wants

* Needs/Wants #1
    * **Needs and Wants** (What does your client and audience need and want?)
        * Client wants to clearly see the score which really helps to make decision.
        * Client wants to be able to select among the tests.
        * Client wants it to look simple, organized and professional.
    * **Design Ideas and Choices** (How will you meet those needs and wants?)
        * We will have the final score shown in the center of the website in the biggest font size.
        * We will create a side bar/ horizontal bar for client to choose among the test.
        * We will use blue/purple as primary hue and some related colors (no more than 3) to make the interface look nice and clean.
    * **Memo** (Justify your decisions; additional notes.)

### Interactivity

For the modules that pop up during testing and show each seperate tests. I would like it to be dynamic in a way that only modules that are really executed will be shown on the screen, according to the user-defined configuration.

Also I am considering making the progress bar dynamic in a way that the user can hover on it and see how many seconds each test takes.

### Current Problems/Questions
